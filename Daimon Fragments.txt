"Is Luisa alive?"

Simon: "Son, I've got just two questions for you. You say that android can think for herself and that she loves you. Sure, I believe you. But I also believe that given a few hours, you could program her to think she's a dog and crawl around on all fours."

"But the thing is, if I were a Telepath, I could reprogram you to act like a dog too. The fact that free will can be lost is no more an argument against free will than me being able to kill you says you're not alive."

"Myself, I don't really give a damn if she's alive or not. (to Luisa, if present: "No Offense") At some point I figure the difference between an AI and a life-like machine is so small as to be meaningless. You treat her with respect just like anyone else."

"Either way, you gotta make a choice and stand by it. If she's just a robot, then I have a city to protect and this conversation is wasting my time. And if you say she's alive, then you're wasting [I]her[/I] time with hemming and hawing."
