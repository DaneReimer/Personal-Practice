Techniques
1: The Power of Discipline
   The Kensai's Incredible skills come from countless hours of practice. You gain a free Kata, for which you must meet all requirements. All your experience costs for Kata are halved. A number of times per day equal to your school rank, you may activate a kata while waiving is preparation time. You may add your Kenjutsu Skill to the total of all your Initiative Rolls

2: Ritual of Steel
   The Kensai moves with blinding speed. You may make an additional attack per round. A number of times per day equal to your school rank, you may gain the benefits of having spent a void point on a kata without spending void. You may not then spend more Void to gain the benefits again.

3: Invincible Blades
   The Kensai has mastered the kata available to him, and their movements and actions come to him as naturally as his next breath. At the beginning of each day, choose one kata you know. That Kata is active as long as you are conscious. You may choose to deactivate this Kata as a free action at any time. You may spend 3 Void Points as an action at any time to switch to a different Kata or to reactivate the same Kata. This Kata does not count as an active Kata for the purposes of having another kata active. You may add twice your Kenjutsu skill to the total of all your Initiative rolls (replacing the Rank 1 Technique benefit)
