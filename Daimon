Nicoale's swing met only air and her slide's momentum carried her past Jason and the bandit chief - he'd reacted to her attack by hopping over it. Still, with his feet off the ground Jason's kicks had been enough to knock the bandit prone.

Nicoale put the breaks on her slide and altered Caladbolg's path, twisting the horizontal slash upward even as she pivoted. Now facing the bandit again, the overhead arc of her blade began its descent as an overhead chop. With her teamate holding the bandit, she leaned into the strike as hard as she could. He wasn't going to escape this time.
